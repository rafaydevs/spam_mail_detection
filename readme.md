# Email Spam Classifier

This project is a spam email classification model built using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). This project uses Streamlit to create an interactive web app where users can interact with the spam classifier.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or later)
- pip (Python's package installer)

## Setup

### 1. Navigate to the project directory:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project:

```
cd email-spam-classifier
```
2. Install dependencies:
Ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed. In the project directory, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all necessary Python libraries for the project.

3. Run the Streamlit app:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the Streamlit app with the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the web application.

4. Access the app:
Once the app is running, open your web browser and go to the following URL:
```
http://localhost:8501
```
You should see the email spam classifier app, ready to classify your emails.
